If you see an asterisk (\\*) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "3. If that doesn't help, restart your server. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save and Checkpoint**. Next, click **Control Panel** at the top right. Choose **Stop My Server** to shut it down, then **Start My Server** to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.
