# Data Applications for Mathematics Students

**Spring 2021**

Here we have a set of notebooks where we teach students basic skills in python as well as the exploration of datasets that illustrate COVID-19 information, and equity in STEM.

A subset of this repository also includes the calculation of the areas under the graph as an introduction to Calculus.
